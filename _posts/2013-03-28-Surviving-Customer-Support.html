This article is going to be another rant.<br /><br />I'm trying to get my hands on an install of MS Office 2013 (well, I really only need PowerPoint to do my presentations, and Word to occasionally read files sent by people who don't know better). &nbsp;Since I'm an honest individual, I decide to do the unthinkable and actually pay for Microsoft software. &nbsp;However, I'm also a student, so I'm looking for a way to pay the least amount possible and still keep a clear conscience. &nbsp;It appears the best option is the <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/en_US/pd/Office-365-University/productID.259180100?ICID=Student_Featured_image">University 365</a> deal that's exclusive to full-time students.  The catch: they have to verify you're a student before you can purchase or even download anything.  This is where the fun begins.<br /><br />You get three options for verification: through your school, an <a href="http://www.isic.org/">ISIC</a> card, or manually typing a verification code into a text box.  The first option sounds like the best, except it doesn't work: you get redirected to your school (in my case, Hokkaido University), you enter a username and password, and... get redirected to the start page.  One option down, two to go.  No, scratch that, I don't have an ISIC card.  Well, that pretty much leaves one option -- get in touch with support and ask for a verification code.  Sounds easy, huh?<br /><br />Actually, it isn't.  Go to <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/home">the MS store</a> and search for a way to contact their support team.  Bonus question: try to find a way that doesn't involve picking up a telephone.  Go on, I'll wait.<br /><br />Back already? &nbsp;Did you find an email? &nbsp;Let me know if you did, cause I didn't. &nbsp;As a consolation prize, I found a chat option... &nbsp;that I can't use right now because it's outside of US business hours. &nbsp;Seriously? &nbsp;Is it really that hard to foresee that not everyone is going to be in the same time zone as the US? &nbsp;It's almost as if Microsoft haven't heard of this wonderful thing called "eemail", which allows people across the globe to communicate without having to arrange a mutually convenient time.<br /><br />Alright, let's try a different angle: let's go through the local Japanese MS site. &nbsp;Maybe they have a workable support option. &nbsp;Here's their <a href="http://www.microsoft.co.jp/">product lineup</a>. &nbsp;I'll save you the time of having to click through to it:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wk_HTmTSBHs/UVP4GzGnWpI/AAAAAAAAAZY/spbYnTt6qTI/s1600/Untitled.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="271" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wk_HTmTSBHs/UVP4GzGnWpI/AAAAAAAAAZY/spbYnTt6qTI/s320/Untitled.png" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Now, it's starting to get ridiculous. &nbsp;Let's find the <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msjp/ja_JP/home/ThemeID.30483000">Microsoft Store in Japan</a>&nbsp;through Google. &nbsp;Thankfully, that site doesn't die with a server error. &nbsp;But hey, remember that thing you wanted to buy half an hour ago... &nbsp;yeah, Microsoft University 365? &nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store?SiteID=msjp&amp;Locale=ja_JP&amp;Action=DisplayProductSearchResultsPage&amp;result=&amp;keywords=university+365">It's not there!</a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PV4W2q4dDKE/UVP74Oh2onI/AAAAAAAAAZw/pk0HnhCUmFA/s1600/nothere.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PV4W2q4dDKE/UVP74Oh2onI/AAAAAAAAAZw/pk0HnhCUmFA/s320/nothere.png" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I'm a patient and persistent guy. &nbsp;Let's try googling around for "Microsoft University 365". &nbsp;<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-office-university-suite-online-subscription-FX102918415.aspx">Here's</a> the first hit from Google, and it looks really promising. &nbsp;There's no link for purchasing information, but there is a "learn more" link. &nbsp;Let's click on that.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3gaDZS-g-mc/UVP70zHgKLI/AAAAAAAAAZo/MUvhbYMpfmw/s1600/notfound.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3gaDZS-g-mc/UVP70zHgKLI/AAAAAAAAAZo/MUvhbYMpfmw/s320/notfound.png" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Patience... &nbsp;running... &nbsp;out...</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Microsoft, here I am, practically <i>begging </i>you to take my money so I can start using your software, and you still can't manage to keep my business. &nbsp;Maybe I'll just have to <b>go and pirate it</b> like the rest of the world does. &nbsp;I value my conscience, but I also value my time and sanity, and they are both taking a huge hit by having to deal with your online store. &nbsp;If you insist on <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/04/microsoft_store_it_s_a_blatant_rip_off_of_the_apple_store_and_it_just_might_save_the_company_.html">copying Apple</a> and dressing up your staff to look like a bunch of clowns, then perhaps you should also look at copying Apple and making it easy for people to actually buy your products.</div>
