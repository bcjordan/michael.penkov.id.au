I recently found out that Google Chrome has a speech recognition component.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/MQnZe_Iggx0" width="560"></iframe><br /><br />(Yes, this video is already 2 years old!) This component utilizes a Web service to do the actual speech recognition. The Web service isn't available officially, but can be accessed without Chrome to perform some quick speech recognition. Here's a script that does the work for you:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/mpenkov/6589233.js"></script> The script is mostly based on existing work by <a href="http://sunilkumarkopparapu.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/using-google-asr/">Sunil</a>. I had to modify a few things to get it working:<br /><br /><ul><li>Fix the fancy quotation marks</li><li>Fix the wget line (it wasn't outputting to the correct file)</li></ul><div>Other than that, full credit should go to Sunil. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>It only seems to work well for smaller files (no more than a couple of seconds of audio). For larger file, the response from the Web service appears to be empty.</div><div><br /></div><div>You can find more details about the API in <a href="https://gist.github.com/alotaiba/1730160">this gist</a>&nbsp;by alotaiba.</div>
