I've moved the blog to a new server.
It now lives on my [very own personal domain](http://michael.penkov.id.au).
The [old blog](http://mishapenkov.blogspot.com) will still be available, but I won't be writing there anymore.

For those that are interested, the new blog is hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com).
The posts are written in simple [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and stored in a git repository.
Each time the repository is pushed, [GitHub](http://github.com) uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to generate a static website from the posts.
All this makes posts easy to write, edit and publish, and keeps everything under version control.
You can see the source code for this blog [here](http://github.com/mpenkov/michael.penkov.id.au).

The migration from [BlogSpot](http://mishapenkov.blogspot.com) was relatively painless.
Jekyll has [migration recipes](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/migrations/) for a variety of existing providers.
There are several alternatives for BlogSpot - [this one](https://gist.github.com/1506614) worked for me. 
It keeps the posts as HTML, as opposed to markdown.
This isn't really a problem for Jekyll, since it handles HTML without any problems; it's just a pain to edit HTML.
Thanks, [@ngauthier](https://github.com/ngauthier)!
Getting the LaTeX equations to display correctly was also [relatively straightforward](http://cwoebker.com/posts/latex-math-magic).

I also migrated my [Russian-language blog](http://kogumamisha.livejournal.com) to [misha.penkov.id.au](http://misha.penkov.id.au).
Unfortunately, there was no [LiveJournal](http://livejournal.com) importer for Jekyll, so I [wrote my own](http://github.com/mpenkov/lj-download).
