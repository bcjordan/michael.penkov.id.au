... or how to share your internet connection.<br /><br />I'm out of town for a conference. &nbsp;I brought my laptop and tablet PC with me. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the hotel room doesn't have wireless -- it only has a LAN port. &nbsp;How can I access the internet through my tablet? &nbsp;Well, since the laptop has a functioning wireless card, it's <a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/debian-ubuntu-linux-setting-wireless-access-point/">not that difficult</a>. &nbsp;You need to run <a href="http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Documentation/hostapd">hostapd</a>, a daemon that implements a wireless Access Point (AP) in software, and bridge-utils to bring the LAN and wireless interfaces. &nbsp;On Ubuntu, these are available directly through apt-get. &nbsp;From there, it's relatively straight forward:<br /><br /><ol><li>Configure the AP (edit&nbsp;/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf to specify SSID, access keys, etc.)</li><li>Configure the bridge (edit /etc/network/interfaces to specify the interfaces you want to bridge, the gateway and DNS servers)</li><li>Restart networking services</li><li>Connect to the created wireless AP and enjoy your bridged connection</li></ol><div>For parts 1 and 2, I used the settings from the <a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/debian-ubuntu-linux-setting-wireless-access-point/">original post directly</a>. &nbsp;I had to change eth1 to eth0 since that's what the LAN interface is called on my system. &nbsp;The IP addresses for the laptop, gateway and DNS server were also obviously different, but readily available through netstat -nr. &nbsp;If you skip step 2, then you won't be get an IP address at step 4 unless DHCP is running on the laptop. &nbsp;If step 2 is performed correctly, then whatever is performing DHCP on the remote side of the LAN connection will perform the IP address allocation and everything will work alright.</div><div><br /></div><div>It's amazing what you can do just by editing a couple of configuration files. &nbsp;Of course, it would be great if all this would all be done through a GUI. &nbsp;There's already nm-applet, which seems to allow one to create an AP, but I couldn't get that going, so I gave up and headed for the command-line option.</div>
