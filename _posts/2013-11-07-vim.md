title: Russian ViM keymap for a Japanese keyboard
categories:

If you:

1. Use [ViM](http://www.vim.org/); and
2. Enter Russian text from time to time; and
3. Use a Japanese keyboard

then this post is for you! Otherwise, you may as well stop reading.

I made a [keymap for ViM](https://github.com/mpenkov/russian-jcuken-jp.vim) that allows you to enter Russian characters in insert mode, and continue using the ViM editor in command mode.
There is probably only a handful of people that meet the above conditions, but I'm one of them, so this was a problem worth spending time on.
I can finally use ViM to enter Russian text on my Japanese MacBook Air.

Ура, товарищи, ура!
