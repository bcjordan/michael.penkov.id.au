A little while ago, I wrote about the <a href="http://mishapenkov.blogspot.jp/2013/03/counting-large-numbers-in-japanese-pita.html">woes of dealing with numbers in Japanese notation</a>. &nbsp;Since I never let an opportunity to procrastinate to pass me by, I also posted a brief JavaScript (The Decimator™) to help deal with the confusion. &nbsp;A friend of mine pointed out that it doesn't help with some use cases, such as&nbsp;千5百万 (that's 15 million, but you knew that, right?). &nbsp;And thus another opportunity to procrastinate presented itself, and now, I give you the Decimator™, 2.0:<br /><br /><a href="http://mpenkov.github.com/decimator/">http://mpenkov.github.com/decimator/</a><br /><br />It accepts free text input, and handles both traditional (Kanji only) and mixed (Arabic numerals plus Kanji) numbers. &nbsp;Feel free to give it a whirl.
