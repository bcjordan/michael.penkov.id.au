title: Remembering chess coordinates

I play chess.
I'm not particularly strong, but I do enjoy a challenge.
In chess, it helps to be able to transform coordinates into actual positions in the board.
For example, when reading chess literature, sequences of moves are often denoted like this: 

1. d4 d5
2. c4 c6

That's the infamous [Slav defense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slav_Defense).
If you're lucky, you'll get an illustration of a chessboard to help you mentally move the pieces around.
For me, going from "d4" to "ah, that's white's Queen pawn" takes a couple of seconds, which can be frustrating when reading longer sequences.
To help myself overcome this handicap, I wrote a quick [JavaScript application](http://jsfiddle.net/mpenkov/yaLJ8/3/embedded/result/).
I'll be writing more of these in the near future. In the meanwhile, why not [challenge me](http://gameknot.com/start-game.pl?chlg=mpenkov) to a game?
