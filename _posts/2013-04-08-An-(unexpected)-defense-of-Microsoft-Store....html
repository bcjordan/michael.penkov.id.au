I know I had a lot of fun bashing Microsoft and their Online Store <a href="http://mishapenkov.blogspot.jp/2013/03/how-to-not-handle-your-customer-support.html">last week</a>, but being a fair and level-minded individual, I feel that I do need to say some things in their defense.<br /><br />While they failed to obtain my business for the <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/en_US/pd/Office-365-University/productID.259180100?ICID=Student_Featured_image">University 365</a> offer (a blunder that they will surely regret for decades), a quick read of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13653">MS Office license</a> revealed that, as a proud owner of the Home and Student version, I can install it on one more PC. &nbsp;Which is what I promptly did (can't beat free!).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the smooth sailing ended here. &nbsp;In blind defiance of the above-mentioned license, the installed program refused to authenticate, and threatened to disable itself within a month if I did not provide it with a new license key, which, as we all know, costs bags of money. &nbsp;Having read the The License, I was fully confident in my self-righteousness. &nbsp;There was no way I was going to pay for something that was already mine. &nbsp;I did the unthinkable. &nbsp;I picked up my phone and called the Verification Hotline.<br /><br />The Verification Hotline is the last resort for people that want to authenticate a Microsoft product, but for one reason or another can't do so over the Internet. &nbsp;It was well after 7pm when I called, so I half-expected to be kindly asked to call back the next day. &nbsp;Fortunately, these expectations were misplaced, and I was treated to a warming chat with... a computer. &nbsp;To proceed with verification, you need to enter something like 64 digits (through the keypad!) to identify your install. &nbsp;It's difficult to convey the rush of adrenaline as you power towards the last couple of digits. &nbsp;I've never diffused a bomb, or issued a launch code for an ICBM, but I guess those experiences would come pretty close.<br /><br />After all that, I got through to an operator. &nbsp;Finally, a chance to plead my case... &nbsp;in Japanese. &nbsp;Great. &nbsp;After a long and thorough discussion about when and how I installed The Product, the operator agreed to activate my installation. &nbsp;To do that, I had to enter another missile launch code into my Office install, as she was reading it out. &nbsp;Another 64 digits or so, and my efforts would finally bear fruit.<br /><br />My call got cut off after 10 digits. &nbsp;Game over, man!<br /><br />Unable to control the fury, I redialed the number, and mashed the keypad until an option to talk to an operator was presented. &nbsp;I had naively expected that somehow, the person I was talking to before would be there, and we could pick up where we left off... &nbsp;Alas, that was not to be. &nbsp;The voice on the other side of the phone was cold and distant. &nbsp;"I'm afraid you'll have to start again...", she said apologetically.<br /><br />Like I mentioned earlier, I'm a fairly persistent guy when I need to be. &nbsp;I persevered. &nbsp;Entering the 64-digit launch code a second time through was nowhere as painful as the first. &nbsp;I had the thought that by the time I'd have gone through the process another 3 or 4 times, I'd have the whole thing memorized. &nbsp;It's really no big deal -- back in the good old days of Windows 95, I reinstalled the O/S so often I had the whole product key committed to memory.<br /><br />While what I've written so far doesn't really do much in defense of the Microsoft Store, there really is a happy ending to all this. &nbsp;After I entered my launch code a second time, I didn't have to jump through any more hoops. &nbsp;The kind soul I spoke to the first time through pre-recorded the authorization code for me, and all I had to do was punch that into my Office install. &nbsp;All done! &nbsp;And it only took half an hour...<br /><br />Furthermore, I had to recently stumble into&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msaus/en_AU/home/">The Store</a>&nbsp;on an unrelated issue. &nbsp;I was surprised to see something that I don't recall seeing before -- a live chat option. &nbsp;You click on that, and get to talk to a real person. &nbsp;Straightaway. &nbsp;It's brilliant! &nbsp;If only that was there a week ago -- I wouldn't have had to rant. &nbsp;Oh well. &nbsp;Better out than in, they say.
